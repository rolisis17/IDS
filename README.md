# IDS

- The goal of this project is to build a simple IDS.
- a real-world IDS is very complex so this one will be very simple.
- Open port check and with instructions for better safety for these ports.
- Failed login attempts check.
- I will try to find a list of "trusted" IPs for checking new connections with the host.
- That's it for now.
